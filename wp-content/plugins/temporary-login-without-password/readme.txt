Create self-expiring, temporary admin accounts. Easily share direct login links (no need for username/password) with your developers or editors.

== Description ==

Create secure, self-expiring ⏱️, automatic login links 🔗 for WordPress. Give them to developers when they ask for admin access to your site. Or an editor for a quick review of work done. Login works just by opening the link, no password needed.

Using the "Temporary Login Without Password" plugin you can create a self-expiring account for someone and give them a special link with which they can login to your WordPress without needing a username and password.

You can choose when the login expires, as well as the role of the temporary account.

Really useful when you need to give admin access to a developer for support or for performing routine tasks.

#### What users have to say about Temporary Login Without Password?

👉 **It works with WordPress.com business plan!**
> I love this plugin! I got the impression that Temporary Login Without Password plugin would only work with WordPress.org sites. When I had a problem with another plugin, I reached out to their tech support. They recommended Temporary Login. I crossed my fingers, installed it, and it worked like a charm. No more worrying about possibly compromising my sites. When tech support was done, I went into the settings and revoked access. This is a game changer!
> - [Suzanne Loeb](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/it-works-with-wordpress-com-business-plan/)

👉 **Convenient. No rabbit holes**
> I can’t say I’ve used a whole bunch of these plugins, but I can say I’ve used 2 or 3. This one was the most straight forward and rushing through it I still didn’t run into any issues. The login was shot to the company I needed to let in and I was able to get back to marking things off of my checklist. Highly recommend to anyone that is needing to make a temporary user account for the first time. There’s literally nowhere to get confused from my personal experience
> - [Peter Higgins](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/convenient-no-rabbit-holes/)

👉 **Clear and efficient.**
> Clear and efficient. Nothing to add !
> Continue like that !
> Make the world of the web even more fun for all pro and amateur users!
> - [muten7](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/clear-and-efficient-2/)

👉 **Excellent Plugin**
> Having problems with another plugin the developer recommended TPWP. It does exactly as it states. The developer was able to identify the bug, done without comprising security. The fact it records the access you have granted is a another advantage.
> - [mickpamg](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-3772/)

👉 **A huge help and easy!**
> This plugin was just what I needed to make it easy for support people to come in and get their assessments done then I don’t have to worry about revoking permission…this takes care of that for me! Love it!!!
